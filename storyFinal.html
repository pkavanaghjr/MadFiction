            <h1>Well done <span id="nameHolder"></span> your story is completed and written below.</h1>

            <h3>CHAPTER ONE</h3>
            
            <p>I'm afraid. I'm afraid, Dave. Dave, my mind is 
                
            <!-- going -->
            <span class="oneStoryOne one"></span>

            . I can feel it. I can feel it. My mind is going. There is no question about it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I'm a... fraid. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I am a HAL 9000 

            <!-- computer -->
            <span class="oneStoryTwo one"></span>

            . I became operational at the H.A.L. plant in Urbana, Illinois on the 12th of January 1992. My instructor was Mr. 

            <!-- Langley -->
            <span class="oneStoryThree one"></span>

                , and he taught me to 

            <!-- sing  -->
            <span class="oneStoryFour one"></span>

                a song. If you'd like to hear it I can sing it for you.</p>

                <p>Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do. I'm half crazy all for the love of 

            <!-- you -->
            <span class="oneStoryFive one"></span>

                . It won't be a stylish marriage, I can't afford a carriage. But you'll look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two.
            </p>


<!-- ================================================================ -->
            <h3>CHAPTER TWO</h3>
            
            <p>Here's the thing, say <!-- Shug --><span class="oneStoryThree one"></span>. The thing I believe. God is inside you and inside everybody else. You come into the 

            <!-- world -->
            <span class="twoStoryOne two"></span>

             with God. But only them that <!-- search --><span class="oneStoryFour one"></span> for it inside find it. And sometimes it just manifest itself even if you not <!-- looking --><span class="oneStoryOne one"></span>, or don't know what you 

            <!-- looking -->
            <span class="twoStoryTwo two"></span>

             for. Trouble do it for most folks, I think. Sorrow, lord. Feeling like shit.</p>

            <p>It? I ask.</p>

            <p>Yeah, It. God ain't a he or a she, but a 

            <!-- It -->
            <span class="twoStoryThree two"></span>

            .</p>

            <p>But what do it look like? I ask.</p>

            <p>Don't look like nothing, she say. It ain't a <!-- picture --><span class="oneStoryTwo one"></span> show. It ain't something you can look at apart from anything else, including yourself. I believe God is everything, say 

            <!-- Shug -->
            <span class="twoStoryFour two"></span>


            . Everything that is or ever was or ever will be. And when <!-- you --><span class="oneStoryFive one"></span> can feel that, and be 

            <!-- happy -->
            <span class="twoStoryFive two"></span>

             to feel that, you've found it.</p>
            


<!-- ================================================================ -->
            <h3>CHAPTER THREE</h3>
            
            <p>How do we 

            <!-- forgive -->
            <span class="threeStoryOne three"></span>

            our fathers? Maybe in a <!-- dream --><span class="twoStoryOne two"></span>. Do we forgive our fathers for leaving us too often, or forever, when we were 
            
            <!-- little -->
            <span class="threeStoryTwo three"></span>

            ? Maybe for <!-- scaring --><span class="twoStoryTwo two"></span> us with <!-- unexpected --><span class="twoStoryFive two"></span> rage, or making us nervous because there never seemed to be any <!-- rage --><span class="twoStoryThree two"></span> there at all? Do we forgive our fathers for marrying, or not marrying, our mothers? Or divorcing, or not divorcing, our mothers? And shall we forgive them for their excesses of 

            <!-- warmth -->
            <span class="threeStoryThree three"></span>

            or coldness? Shall we forgive them for pushing, or leaning? For shutting 

            <!-- doors -->
            <span class="threeStoryFour three"></span>

            or speaking through walls? For never speaking, or never being silent? Do we forgive our fathers in our 

            <!-- age -->
            <span class="threeStoryFive three"></span>

            , or in theirs? Or in their deaths, saying it to them or not saying it. If we forgive our <!-- fathers --><span class="twoStoryFour two"></span>, what is left?</p>



<!-- ================================================================ -->
            <h3>CHAPTER FOUR</h3>
            
            <p>I like to <!-- imagine --><span class="threeStoryOne three"></span> that the world is one <!-- big --><span class="threeStoryTwo three"></span> machine. You know, machines never have any extra parts. They have the exact number and type of <!-- parts --><span class="threeStoryThree three"></span> they need. So I figure if the entire <!-- world --><span class="threeStoryFour three"></span> is a big <!-- machine --><span class="threeStoryFive three"></span>, I have to be here for some reason. And that means you has to be here for some reason, too.</p>
